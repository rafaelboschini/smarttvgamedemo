# ðŸ“º Smart TV Game Demo

## Project Description

Welcome to our Proof of Concept (POC) project aimed at testing the viability of creating a fun app for Smart TVs. This project is a parody of the classic Duck Hunt game for NES but with a twist â€“ it features the faces of my kids! The app supports the Magic Control, allowing children to aim and hit targets. No engines were used; we relied solely on vanilla JavaScript.
